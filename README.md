# Ferns and Petals Sales Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

This repository contains an Excel-based dashboard project focused on analyzing sales data for "Ferns and Petals" (FNP), a company specializing in sending gifts for various occasions. The project aims to provide key insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance to help FNP improve its sales strategy and optimize customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

The project follows a typical data analysis workflow, leveraging Excel's capabilities for data extraction, cleaning, transformation, modeling, and visualization. The core of the project involves building an interactive dashboard to present crucial business insights.

## Problem Statement: Ferns and Petals Sales Analysis

**Objective:** To analyze a given dataset containing details about products, orders, customers, and relevant dates to uncover key insights related to sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

**Key Business Questions to be Addressed:**

1.  **Total Revenue:** Identify the overall revenue.
2.  **Average Order and Delivery Time:** Evaluate the time taken for orders to be delivered.
3.  **Monthly Sales Performance:** Examine how sales fluctuate across the months of 2023.
4.  **Top Products by Revenue:** Determine which products are the top revenue generators.
5.  **Customer Spending Analysis:** Understand how much customers are spending on average.
6.  **Sales Performance by Top 5 Product:** Track the sales performance of the top 5 products.
7.  **Top 10 Cities by Number of Orders:** Find out which cities are placing the highest number of orders.
8.  **Order Quantity vs. Delivery Time:** Analyze if higher order quantities impact delivery times.
9.  **Revenue Comparison Between Occasions:** Compare revenue generated across different occasions.
10. **Product Popularity by Occasion:** Identify which products are most popular during specific occasions.

## Data Analysis Workflow

The project utilizes the following steps, primarily within Excel:

1.  **PQE (Power Query Editor) - Extract Data:**
    * Initial extraction of raw data into Power Query.

2.  **Cleaning:**
    * Addressing data inconsistencies, missing values, and errors to ensure data quality.

3.  **Transformation:**
    * Reshaping and transforming the data as needed for analysis (e.g., creating new columns, pivoting/unpivoting data).

4.  **Data Modelling:**
    * Establishing relationships between different tables in the dataset to enable comprehensive analysis.

5.  **Data Analysis:**
    * Performing calculations and aggregations to derive insights relevant to the business questions. This often involves creating "Best Tables & Measures" (e.g., pivot tables, calculated fields) within Excel.

6.  **Dashboard Creation:**
    * Designing and building an interactive dashboard in Excel to visualize the analyzed data. The dashboard serves as an "Executive Summary" for quick insights.

7.  **Power BI (Optional/Future Scope):**
    * While the primary focus is Excel, the project's data modeling and analysis can be extended to Power BI for more advanced visualizations and interactive reporting.
